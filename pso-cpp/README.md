# Data Oriented PSO Algorithms

## Build Instructions
From the project root directory run the following:

### Debug Build
```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

### Release Build
```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Note: these need to be run each time you want to switch to a different
      build type.
